### **2024 Budget Analysis & Dashboard**

---

### **Project Overview**
This project presents a comprehensive budget analysis for 2024, designed to track and visualize personal or business finances. The primary goal is to provide a clear, interactive dashboard to monitor spending, categorize expenses according to the **50/30/20 rule** (Needs, Wants, and Savings), and ensure the budget stays on track throughout the year.

---

### **Key Questions Addressed**
* What is the overall financial health of the budget on a monthly and quarterly basis?
* How does actual spending compare to budgeted amounts for each category?
* What percentage of the budget is allocated to Needs, Wants, and Savings?
* Where can spending be optimized to meet financial goals?

### **Data Source**
The dashboard is built on a dataset detailing income, budgeted expenses, and actual expenses for the year 2024. PDF provided with raw dataset used for analysis.

### **Methodology & Tools**
The project was executed using **Power BI** to transform and visualize the data:

1.  **Data Modeling:** The dataset was imported into Power BI and structured for effective analysis.
2.  **KPIs and Custom Measures:** Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were created to track financial health, and custom measures were written to calculate variances and percentages against budget.
3.  **Dashboard Design:** A multi-page dashboard was designed to provide both a high-level summary and detailed breakdowns for each category.

**Tools Used:**
* **Power BI:** For all data modeling, transformation, and visualization.
* **Excel:** For initial data compilation (implied from a common data source for budgeting projects).
